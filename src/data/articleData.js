      <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Discover how smart cities are revolutionizing urban living and how KPNG is at the forefront of this transformation. As urban populations grow, cities are embracing cutting-edge technology to enhance efficiency, connectivity, and sustainability.
      </p>
  
      <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Defining Smart Cities</h2>
      <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Smart cities leverage digital infrastructure, data-driven decision-making, and IoT integration to improve urban services. By deploying AI-powered traffic systems, smart grids, and automated waste management, cities enhance quality of life while reducing environmental impact.
      </p>
  
      <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">AI and IoT: The Backbone of Smart Infrastructure</h2>
      <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) enable real-time data analysis and predictive maintenance in urban areas. Sensors monitor air quality, traffic congestion, and energy consumption, allowing city planners to optimize resources dynamically.
      </p>
  
      <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Sustainable Urban Mobility</h2>
      <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The future of smart cities includes intelligent transportation networks featuring electric buses, autonomous vehicles, and shared mobility solutions. With 5G connectivity, self-driving cars and smart traffic lights will streamline urban commutes, reducing emissions and congestion.
      </p>
  
      <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Smart Buildings and Energy Efficiency</h2>
      <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Buildings equipped with smart sensors optimize energy consumption, using AI to adjust lighting, heating, and cooling based on occupancy. Integrated renewable energy solutions, such as solar panels and energy storage, contribute to carbon-neutral cityscapes.
      </p>
  
      <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Challenges and Ethical Considerations</h2>
      <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        While smart cities promise efficiency and sustainability, concerns around data privacy, cybersecurity, and equitable access remain. Governments and tech firms must collaborate to ensure ethical implementation of digital solutions, prioritizing citizen rights and inclusivity.
      </p>
  
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-600 pl-4 sm:pl-6 my-6 sm:my-8 italic text-lg sm:text-xl text-[#174e75]">
        "The city of the future isn’t just about technology—it’s about creating inclusive, sustainable, and intelligent environments for all."
      </blockquote>
  
      <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        As global urbanization accelerates, smart city initiatives will shape the next generation of metropolitan living. Through technological innovation and strategic urban planning, cities will become more adaptive, resilient, and people-centric.
